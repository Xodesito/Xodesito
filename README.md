### Xodesito
_(an attempt to be better)_

I am a person with the intention of being able to fulfill a dream, trying to do everything to achieve it.

- 🌱 I am currently trying to improve my knowledge of Java and I am interested in learning other programming languages.
- 💬 I speak English, Portuguese and Spanish (Spanish is my native language)
- 🔭 Currently I do not work in any company, since I am studying to be the best in what I try.
